    TESTDIRINFO describes the 'testdirinfo.txt' file that describes the stimuli run in each test directory

    The file 'testdirinfo.txt' at the root level of the directory DS,
    has the following structure. The first row has the category titles
    'testdir' and 'types', separated by a tab. Then each row has a test
    directory name followed by a tab and a comma-separated list of types.

    This file is typically created by the user while the experimental data
    is collected.

    The function that reads this file is ADD_TESTDIR_INFO.

    As an example of the form:

    testdir<tab>types
    t00001<tab>PreDir1Hz, Dir1Hz1
    t00002<tab>PreDir4Hz, Dir4Hz1
    t00003<tab>PostDir1Hz, Dir1Hz2
    t00004<tab>PostDir4Hz, Dir4Hz2
