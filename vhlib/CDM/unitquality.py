    Info for the unitquality.txt file, used to determine which cells to keep and which to remove

    The unitquality.txt file is one way of specifying the quality of single
    units analyzed using the Plexon Offline Spike Sorter.

    The format of the file is as follows. The first row has field names, separated
    by tabs. Each additional row has the values of those fields.

    channel<tab>unit<tab>goodtestdirs<tab>qualitycode<tab>comment

    Channel is the channel number that the recording is on in the file that has been
    prepared for Plexon.  The text file 'vhlv_channelgrouping.txt' describes the mapping
    between channels in the Plexon file and records in the 'reference.txt' file.

    IF there is a shift between the channels in Plexon and the channels described in the
    rerference.txt files, then there should be an additional file 'unitquality_channelshift.txt'
    with a single line that has the shift to apply. For example, if the 1st channel was used as
    a sync channel, then this number should be -1 so that Plexon channel 2 shifts to the first entry
    of the reference list.

    It is assumed that all channels use a name/ref of 'extraN',
    and that the reference number is 1; unit is a list of units to be included; can
    be 'a,b,c' or '401,402,403',etc; goodtestdirs is a list of directories that have
    valid data for those cells; qualitycode is a code that describes the quality of
    the recorings and can be 'multinit' (or 'mu'),'excellent' ('e'),'good' ('g'),
    'not useable' ('nu').  Comment can be any text the user wants.
