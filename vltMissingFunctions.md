# Missing functions from vlt (vhlab-toolbox-python)

The following functions were found to be missing in `vhlab-toolbox-python` but are required by `vhlab-library-python`:

- `string2associates` (likely in `vlt.data`)
- `load2celllist` (likely in `vlt.data`)
- `getstimdirectorytime` (function)

Note: `findassociate`, `associate`, `disassociate`, `associate_all` are now implemented in `vhlib.md`.
`getpathname`, `gettests`, `saveexpvar`, `getexperimentfile` are available in `vlt.file.dirstruct`.
`loadStructArray` is available in `vlt.file.custom_struct_io`.
